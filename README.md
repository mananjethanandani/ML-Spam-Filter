# ML-Spam-Filter-comparison-
Spam Filter built with Python using sklearn Machine learning libraries.
This project is inspired from one of the assignment in the online ML course at Coursera-"Building Spam Classifier from SVM".

Here this project will involve different Machine Learning model selection which will be trained from preprocessed data sets.These includes:
1: Multinomial Naive Bayes Classification
2:Logistic Regression
3:k-NN classifier with Grid-Search for tuning n_neighbors
4: Ensemble classifier
5:Linear Support Vector Machines(SVM).

And all these ML algorithm models will be compared based on their accuracy of classifying spam emails.
